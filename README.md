# Bond-Pricing
Pricing a 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 30-year bond with a market rate of 3% and a coupon rate of 5% paid annually. Graphed the results with curve smoothening
First time using Quantlib, so I wanted to do something simple. 
I tried a Spot Curve and a Flat Curve to see I would get different results; in this example, I did not. However, changing the spot rates for the treasuries would alter the bond value accordingly. 


I also priced a 30-year zero coupon bond (rate of 0.01, volatility of 0.01, and alpha of 0.1: all made up) using the Hull White Model.
