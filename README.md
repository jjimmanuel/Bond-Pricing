# Bond-Pricing
Pricing a 30-year bond with a market rate of 3% and a coupon rate of 5% paid annually. 
First time using Quantlib, so I wanted to do something simple. 
I tried a Spot Curve and a Flat Curve to see I would get different results; in this example, I did not. However, changing the spot rates for the treasuries would alter the bond value accordingly.
